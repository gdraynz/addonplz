# WoW addon installer

Shamelessly pulls data from multiple WoW addon websites to search and install addons easily.

## Features

* Search (by name) and download addons from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons), [WoW interface](https://www.wowinterface.com/addons.php) and [Tukui](https://www.tukui.org/addons.php) websites.
* Automatically checks for updates.
* Import/export addons list to share or backup.

## dev

```
npm i
npm run electron-dev
```

## Maintenance

As I play WoW pretty much on and off I may not be able to maintain this properly, please consider looking at [other addon managers](https://ogri-la.github.io/wow-addon-managers/).
